## Contents
This repository is split into several folders.
1. `Data` contains the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (PIDD).
2. `Proposal` contains the propasal of the study. 
3. `Simulation code` contains the script to do the analysis. 

## Software requirements
This simulation study was conducted in R (version 4.0.5) using RStudio (version 1.2.5042). 
Below you can find packages used and the specific versions.

| Package | Version | Description |

| `mice`   | 3.13.7   | Performing multiple imputation |
| `ggplot`  | 3.3.3   | Data visualization |
| `tidyverse` | 1.3.0 | Data wrangling |
| `dplyr`   | 1.0.6   | A grammar of data manipulation |
| `jtools`  | 2.1.3   | Analysis and Presentation of Social Scientific Data |
| `tidyr`   | 1.1.3   | Tidy messy data |
| `purrr`   | 0.3.4   | Functional programming tools |


## Privacy and ethical approval
As this is a simulation study in which not only missingness, but also the data were simulated, no privacy issues had to be dealt with.
